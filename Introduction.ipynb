    "This notebook serves as an introduction to the student research project and definitions of key terms are introduced. To be able to follow the work, it is assumed to understand the game of chess as far as possible. It should be known what pieces exist, what moves they can make, when a player is checkmate, when a game ends in stalemate and any other basics needed to play a game of chess. This student research project introduces both the concept of Endgame Tablebase and Retrograde Analysis and how they are used to play an endgame \"perfectly\". Furthermore, an own program for playing chess endgames is developed, which handles different endgames using custom created tablebases. To simulate the chess game itself the Python library [chess](https://python-chess.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is used."

    "The goal of the student research project is the generation of custom tablebases with the help of the Retrograde Analysis. First of all a program is implemented, which allows to play endgames using the Gaviota tablebases. In the following an implementation of the Retrograde Analysis is made, i.e. the computation of the DTMs of all sitatuations of an endgame. Finally, the program is extended so that the custom created tablebases can also be used for playing. The results are checked in the conclusion with tests."
