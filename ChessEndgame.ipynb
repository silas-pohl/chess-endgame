    "## What Is This Jupyter Notebook About?\n",
    "The following notebook can be used to play any chess endgame with up to 4 pieces. To simulate the chess game itself the Python library [chess](https://python-chess.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is used. Each game is exported and may be re-imported to retrace the game. The moves of white can be determined by yourself or randomly and the moves of black are determined with the help of the [Gaviota endgame tablebases](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Gaviota_Tablebases) developed by Miguel A. Ballicora. The tablebases are probed using a C-based API to determine the depth-to-mate (i.e., the number of half-moves until a player is mated) for a given situation on a chessboard and using this depth-to-mate information, the best possible move for black is played. In general, Gaviota supports endgames with up to 5 pieces. However, this implementation only includes the tablebases with up to 4 pieces.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic idea is to declare the ChessEndgame class first and then create it incrementally, so that the notebook is easy to understand and nevertheless a complete class is created. This is necessary because we want to override / extend the methods of this created class in a subsequent notebook, so not only the Gaviota tablebases, but custom tablebases, which were created by means of the so-called retrograde analysis, can be used."

Alternatively, the methods could have been made to start with a dunder (double underscore). This way, Python name mangling intervenes and the methods are textually replaced with `_classname__method`. Thus, for example, load_engame_config could no longer be called by `instance._load_engame_config`, but only by `instance._ChessEndgame__load_endgame_config`. However, this name mangling is mainly to prevent name collisions with subclasses and would only complicate the incremental creation of class methods.

For this the 4 cases described above are distinguished. FEN or EPD strings are simply passed to the `chess.board` constructor. The specification of the chess pieces as string or list uses another auxiliary function: `piece_str_to_board`. This generates random squares for the given pieces and sets them to the squares. By using a set as data structure for the squares it is ensured that each piece is assigned a different square and thus no square is overwritten. Finally, the pieces are combined with the respective fields and placed on the board via a dictionary / piece map.The last case, where only one color is specified, which should have an advantage, is also used the previously described `piece_str_to_board` function.  Before that, however, a random position is selected from predefined interesting positions. If the declared cases are not met, an exception is raised which interrupts the program call and informs the end user that the `endgame_config` was not specified correctly and thus cannot be interpreted correctly."

    "Finally the auxiliary method `black_move` follows, which is responsible for the black half-moves. It also receives the current board as a parameter and the open tablebase, which is used to select the best move. For this, first a random move of the legal moves is executed and it is checked if this puts white in checkmate. If not, we request the depth to mate from the tablebase and run into a loop, which tries all legal moves on the same way. After each move we check if the depth-to-mate of the executed move is better than the depth to mate of the previous best move. Additionally, the check for checkmate is executed each time, since checkmate returns the same depth-to-mate as stalemate or balanced positions (0). So a move that checkmates white would not be distinguishable from very bad moves that lead to stalemate or an even position. However, all other moves can be compared by their depth-to-mate. This is done in the additional auxiliary method `is_better_move`. This gets two depth-to-mate as integer and tells whether the first or the second is better for black. The value depth-to-mate meets the following specification:\n",
    "\n",
    ">Probes for depth to mate information.\n",
    ">The absolute value is the number of half-moves until forced mate (or 0 in drawn positions). The value is positive if the side to move is winning, otherwise it is negative. (see [Docs](https://python-chess.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gaviota.html#chess.gaviota.PythonTablebase.probe_dtm))\n",
    "\n",
    "In our concrete example, black half-moves are executed and then the depth-to-mate is queried. This means that it is white's move, so a positive depth-to-mate means that white can force a win in depth-to-mate half-moves. On the other hand, a negative value means that black can force a win in so many half-moves. 0 means either a position where no color can force a win, stalemate or checkmate (this is the reason why checkmate is queried beforehand). Better for black in this case means therefore a negative number as close to zero as possible but not equal to zero (checkmates are already detected beforehand as described above). This means we have three cases:\n",
    "1. If the old value is positive, white is winning. Better moves would be:\n",
    " - Any greater value than the current, which would increase the number of moves until forced mate\n",
    " - Any value of zero or lower: this would flip the game, by indicating either a draw, or that black is winning\n",
    "2. If the old value is negative, black is winning. Better moves would be:\n",
    " - Any value closer to zero (greater than old value), but not zero (because we already checked for checkmate) and not positive\n",
    "3. If the old value is zero, the game is facing a draw. Better moves would be:\n",
    " -  Any value less than zero, which would mean that black is winning"
