As they have not been sorted into an $S_n$, they are positions in which neither player can force a checkmate. They also receive a DTM of zero, just like the checkmate boards. The next test function is designed to test those boards. First, every $S_n$ from the list of sets, is subtracted from $S$ to get the remaining boards. Then we can iterate through each of these and assert that the Gaviota DTM must be zero for all of them. "
