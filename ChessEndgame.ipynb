    "The following notebook can be used to play any chess endgame with up to 4 pieces. Each game is exported and may be re-imported to retrace the game. The moves of white can be determined by yourself or randomly and the moves of black are determined with the help of the [Gaviota endgame tablebases](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Gaviota_Tablebases) developed by Miguel A. Ballicora. The depth to mate value is used to play the best possible move for black and execute ut automatically. In general, Gaviota supports endgames with up to 5 pieces. However, this implementation only includes the tablebases with up to 4 pieces, because this is the number of characters that we will support later with the custom created tablebases\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic idea is to declare the ChessEndgame class first and then create it incrementally, so that the notebook is easy to understand and nevertheless a complete class is created. This is necessary because we want to override / extend the methods of this created class in a subsequent notebook, so not only the Gaviota tablebases, but custom tablebases, which were created by means of the so-called retrograde analysis, can be used."

Alternatively, the methods could have been made to start with a dunder (double underscore). This way, Python name mangling intervenes and the methods are textually replaced with `_classname__method`. Thus, for example, load_engame_config could no longer be called by `instance._load_engame_config`, but only by `instance._ChessEndgame__load_endgame_config`. However, this name mangling is mainly to prevent name collisions with subclasses and would only complicate the incremental creation of class methods.

The method returns None, because the moves are executed directly on the given board. If the export_only flag is set to true, a random legal move is simply executed on the current board. However, if the flag is set to false, the user is asked which move to play for white. Entering an empty string (i.e. just Enter) will also execute a random move. Alternatively, a legal move can be entered in UCI format (e.g. a1a2). If the input has a wrong format or the move is not legal, the question is asked again until a legal move is entered."

    "This method is needed to evaluate whether a particular move is better than another move. For this, the two depth-to-mate values of the moves are passed into the method and True is returned if the first is better, and False if the second is better. This evaluation enables the best possible move for black to be played automatically. In our concrete example, black half-moves are executed and then the depth-to-mate is queried. This means that it is white's move, so a positive depth-to-mate means that white can force a win in depth-to-mate half-moves. On the other hand, a negative value means that black can force a win in so many half-moves. 0 means either a position where no color can force a win, stalemate or checkmate. Better for black in this case means therefore a negative number as close to zero as possible but not equal to zero (we will detect checkmates beforehand). This means we have three cases:\n",
    "1. If the old value is positive, white is winning. Better moves would be:\n",
    " - Any greater value than the current, which would increase the number of moves until forced mate\n",
    " - Any value of zero or lower: this would flip the game, by indicating either a draw, or that black is winning\n",
    "2. If the old value is negative, black is winning. Better moves would be:\n",
    " - Any value closer to zero (greater than old value), but not zero and not positive\n",
    "3. If the old value is zero, the game is facing a draw. Better moves would be:\n",
    " -  Any value less than zero, which would mean that black is winning"

    "The last auxiliary method is responsible for the black half-moves. It receives the current board as a parameter and a pythonic_tablebase, which is used to select the best move. For this, first a random move of the legal moves is executed and it is checked if this puts white in checkmate. If not, we request the depth to mate from the tablebase and run into a loop, which tries all legal moves on the same way. After each move we check if the depth-to-mate of the executed move is better than the depth to mate of the previous best move. Additionally, the check for checkmate is executed each time, since checkmate returns the same depth-to-mate as stalemate or balanced positions (0). So a move that checkmates white would not be distinguishable from very bad moves that lead to stalemate or an even position. However, all other moves can be compared by their depth-to-mate. This is done by the previously defined `is_better_move` method."
