    "Retrograde analysis is an algorithm that can be used to generate a tablebase $T \\in \\text{TABLEBASE}$ for a given endgame $E \\in \\text{ENDGAME}$. The goal is to determine a value $n$ which indicates for each board $b \\in E$ in how many half-moves a checkmate can be forced. This value $n$ can then be trivially converted into the depth-to-mate value, so that a relation between each board $b \\in E$ and the depth-to-mate value arises - i.e. a tablebase. To assign a value to each board, we will first take a look at all checkmate position and assign them the value 0 for $n$. Then we move backwords and explore all possible moves one by one while incrementing $n$.\n",
